### Hadith

Below is a hadith about consistency i have provided below you can read it

Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Albani

عن أبي هريرة قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ اكْلَفُوا مِنْ الْعَمَلِ مَا تُطِيقُونَ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الْعَمَلِ أَدْوَمُهُ وَإِنْ قَلَّ

### Conclusion

So we should try to always be consistent even in the small acts that we do as they are more beloved than the big acts if we do not remain consistent in them.
