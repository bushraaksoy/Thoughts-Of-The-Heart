### Hadith

Below is a hadith about consistency i have provided below you can read it
it explains that consistency in something small is better.

Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Albani

```
عن أبي هريرة قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ اكْلَفُوا مِنْ الْعَمَلِ مَا تُطِيقُونَ فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الْعَمَلِ أَدْوَمُهُ وَإِنْ قَلَّ

So we should try to always be consistent even in the small acts that we do as they are more beloved than the big acts if we do not remain consistent in them.
